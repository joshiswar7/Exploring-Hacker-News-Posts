# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.  

What is interesting is that here we would be interested in focussing on posts where the titles begin with either 'Ask HN' or 'Show HN'. Users Use Ask HN to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.

Examples

Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?
Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?

Similarly, users use Show HN to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

Examples

Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'
Show HN: Something pointless I made

Now we would aim at comparing these two types of posts and explore:  Do Ask HN or Show HM receive more comments on average? Do posts created at a certsain time receive more comments on average?
